## HBD

HBD - Heart Beat Distance

HBD is a very data field that computes the distance travelled per heart-beat.

Similarly to the Physiological Cost Index.

HBD provides a simple yet effective measure to gauge how efficiently your heart is able to support physical activity. A higher HBD value would indicate a more efficient cardiovascular performance, as more distance is covered per heartbeat. Conversely, a lower HBD value might suggest inefficiency or increased cardiovascular strain.…More

# What’s New
Version: 1.2.0

New option setting: 'Use Power Instead of Velocity (Experimental)'

By enabling this option, the HBD ratio is calculated using power rather than velocity. This alternative approach can be useful in scenarios where measuring speed is not practical, shifting the focus to the work done during physical activity.

Version: 1.1.3

Average HBD can be seen on Statistics view at the end of the session.
