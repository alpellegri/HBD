## HBD

Garmin app - Heart Beat Distance

HBD is a very data field that computes the distance travelled per heart-beat.

Similarly to the Physiological Cost Index, but without using Resting heart rate.

HBD provides a simple yet effective measure to gauge how efficiently your heart is able to support physical activity. A higher HBD value would indicate a more efficient cardiovascular performance, as more distance is covered per heartbeat. Conversely, a lower HBD value might suggest inefficiency or increased cardiovascular strain.

# Example Calculation:

If you ran 10 kilometers and your average heart rate was 150 beats per minute (bpm) over a period of 50 minutes, the total number of heartbeats can be calculated as:

Total Heart Beats = 150 bpm * 50 minutes = 7500 beats

HBD = 1000 [m] / 7500 [b] = 1.33 [m/b]

By monitoring HBD over time, you can gain insights into improvements in your cardiovascular efficiency and overall fitness.
